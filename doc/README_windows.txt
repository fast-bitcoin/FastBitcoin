Fastbitcoin Core 0.14.0
=====================

Intro
-----
Fastbitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run fastbitcoin-qt.exe.

Fastbitcoin Core is the original Fastbitcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Fastbitcoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process should take only a few hours.

See the official website:
